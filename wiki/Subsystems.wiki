=Graphics=

===Scene===
A Scene is a surface for drawing 2D graphics via the birdtoast engine.

===Texture===
A birdtoast Texture is simply a wrapper for an OpenGL texture with functions for loading the texture and variables for the dimensions of the texture.

===Animations===
There are two types of animations in the birdtoast engine:
  # Animation: Animation based on multiple frames per texture.  It can be loaded by specifying a file or a texture along with the number of frames in the x and y directions.  Each frame is cached into a display list on load.
  # Movement: Interpolated keyframe based animation of the constituent parts of a character or object.

===Sprite===
A Sprite is an Animation object with position, rotation, and velocity information.

==Worlds==
The graphics of each level consist of a tile-set, and up to two backgrounds to scroll in parallax with the tiled terrain.  These elements are pieced together by a tile-set file which specifies the animations for tile image files and the way in which players will interact with the tile.

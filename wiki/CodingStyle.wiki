#summary Style guidelines/practices to adhere to so that we don't confuse eachother.
#labels Phase-Implementation

=General Naming=
Names of functions and variables generally begin with a lower-case letter with the first letter of each successive word capitalized.

*Class* names should be capitalized

For example:
{{{
class MyType
{
public:
    int getInt();

private:
    int memberInt;
};
}}}

=Variable Names=
*Global Variables* : Prefixed by `g_` :  `int g_globalInt`

*Constants* should be all caps.  `#define SOME_CONST 1337`

=Commenting=
Just make it so that we all get it.
In other, words: Just code good.  Or maybe even gooder than that.
===Documenting Classes===
Who cares, unless we both need to use them
===Documenting Functions===
Again, who cares?

=Code Structure=
*Brackets* should be given their own line for clarity.
{{{
void myFunc()
{
   ...
}
}}}

=Class Structure=
(Private/Public, Functions/Vars, Comments etc.)

=File Structure=
(Where to put globals, global functions, includes, definitions, main, etc.)

,,I don't want to just define everything, please change stuff and we can finalize later.  Just put in what you think will work well and mark what you dont like somehow.  Plus, this doesn't have to be that strict, I just want to get an idea for how things are going to look.,,

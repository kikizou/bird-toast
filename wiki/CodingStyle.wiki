=General Naming=
Names of functions and variables generally begin with a lower-case letter with the first letter of each successive word capitalized.

*Class* names should be capitalized

For example:
{{{
class MyType
{
public:
    int getInt();

private:
    int m_memberInt;
};
}}}

=Variable Names=
*Global Variables* : Prefixed by `g_` :  `int g_globalInt`

*Member Variables* : Prefixed by `m_` :  `int m_memberInt`

*Constants* should be all caps.  `#define SOME_CONST 1337`

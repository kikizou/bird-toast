const char* to enum ACTION
enum ACTION to SDLK_* (array indexed by ACTION of Uint8s or SDLK_s)

to get char* for SDLKey, refer to SDL_KeyboardEvent...

use these maps in conjunction with SDL_GetKeyState(NULL):

{{{

void SomeClass::update()
{
    Uint8* keys = SDL_GetKeyState(NULL);

    if(keys[getKeyFromAction(ACTION)] == 1) /* Key Pressed */
    {
        /* Handle input for ACTION */
    }
}

}}}

This way the key pressed can be dynamically defined.
